      Using javascript, resolve this with variables and function names that are human friendly:

      You are keeping score for a baseball game with strange rules. The game consists of several roundes, where the scores of past rounds may affect future rounds
   scores.

      At the beginning of the game, you start with an empty record. You are given a list of strings 'ops', where'ops[i]' is the 'ith' operation you must apply to 
   the record and is one of the following:

      1. An integer x - Record of a new score of x.
      2. "+" - Record a new score that is the sum of the previous two scores. Its guaranteed there will always be two previous scores.
      3. "D" - Record a new score that is double the previous score. Its guaranteed there will always be a previous score.
      4. "C" Invalidate the previous score, removing it from the record. Its guaranteed there will always be a previous score.

   Return the sum of all scores on the record.

   > Example of an execution:

      Input: ops = ["5", "2", "C", "D", "+"]
      Output: 30
      Explanation:
         "5" - Add 5 to the record, record is now [5]
         "2" - Add 2 to the record, record is now [5,2]
         "C" - INvalidate and remove the previous score, record is now [5]
         "D" - Add 2 * 5 = 10 to the record, record is now [5, 10].
         "+" - Add 5 + 10 = 15 to the record, record is now [5, 10, 15].
         The total sum is 5 + 10 + 15 = 30.

   > Example 2:
      Input: ops = ["5", "-2", "4", "C", "D", "9", "+", "+"]
      Output: 27
      explanation:
         "5" - Add 5 to the record, record is now [5].
         "-2" - Add -2 to the record, record is now [5, -2].
         "4" - Add 4 to the record, record is now [5, -2, 4].
         "C" - Invalidate and remove the previous score, record is now [5, -2]
         "D" - Add 2 * -2  = -4 to the record, record is now [5, -2, -4]
         "9" - Add 9 to the record, record is now [5, -2, -4, 9]
         "+" - Add -4 + 9 = 5 to the record, record is now [5, -2, -4, 9, 5]
         "+" - Add 9 + 5 = 14 to the record, record is now [5, -2, -4, 9, 5, 14]
         The total sum is 5 + -2 + -4 + 9 + 5 + 14 = 27.

   > Example 3:
      Input: ops = ["1"]
      Output: 1

   Constraints: 
      1) 1 <= ops.length <=1000
      2) ops[i] is "C", "D", "+" or a string representing an integer in the range [-3 * 104,  3*104]
      3) For operation "+" there will always be at least two previous scores on the record
      4) For operations "C" and "D", there will alwaybs be at least one previous score on the record

 /*
  Given a string of 10 digits illustrating how the keys are positioned. To type a 
  digit, you start from index zero to the index of the target digit. It takes |a- b| 
  milliseconds to move from index a to index b.

  Write a function to calculate the number of milliseconds needed to type a number 
  with one finger.

  Example 1: 
    * Input: digits "0123456789", num = "210"
    * Output: 4

  Example 2: 
    * Input: digits = "8459761203", num "5439"
    * Output: 17

  Contraints:
    1) digits.length == 10
    2) digits contains each digit [0-9] exactly once in some order.
    3) 1 <= num.length <= 10^4
    4) num[i] is digit.

  const a = "0123456789"
  const b = "210"
